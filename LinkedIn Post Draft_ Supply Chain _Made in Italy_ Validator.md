**(Start with a strong hook and a question)**

**Hook:** The EU's Digital Product Passport is coming. Is your supply chain ready for the compliance spotlight?

I just finished building a **GraphRAG** application to solve this exact problem for the luxury fashion industry. Introducing the **Supply Chain "Made in Italy" Validator**—a full-stack solution that ensures transparency and traceability for brands like Gucci and Prada.

**(Highlight the key technical features and skills)**

This project demonstrates the power of combining cutting-edge AI with graph databases:

1.  **GraphRAG Engine (LangChain + Neo4j)**: I used LangChain to translate complex natural language questions (e.g., "Who supplies the leather for the 2024 collection?") into relationship-aware graph queries. This is **GraphRAG** in action, providing accurate, verifiable answers that traditional RAG can't match.

2.  **Human-in-the-Loop (LangGraph)**: Compliance requires human oversight. I implemented a **LangGraph** state machine that uses AI to assess certification confidence (High/Medium/Low) and flags uncertain cases for human review. This is crucial for creating an auditable, compliant workflow.

3.  **Full-Stack Delivery (Streamlit)**: The entire system is wrapped in a professional, interactive Streamlit frontend, making it easy for compliance officers to query the data, validate certifications, and trace any product back to its origin.

**(Call to action and links)**

This project showcases expertise in **GraphRAG**, **LangGraph**, **Neo4j integration**, and **full-stack AI application development**—the high-value skills defining the future of enterprise AI.

I've documented the entire process, including the architecture, data model, and code.

## 📸 Suggested Screenshots (Attach 3-4 images)

To maximize engagement, you should include 3-4 high-quality screenshots of the running Streamlit application:

1.  **The Main Query Tab**: A clean shot of the application's main page with a query typed in (e.g., "Who supplies the leather for the 2024 collection?") and the AI's answer displayed. *This shows the core functionality.*
2.  **The Trace Products Tab**: A shot of the complete supply chain trace for a product (e.g., "Dionysus Leather Handbag"), showing the Factory, Materials, and Suppliers sections expanded. *This shows the Digital Product Passport in action.*
3.  **The Certification Validation Tab**: A shot of the validation summary, showing the Auto-Approved (High Confidence) and Rejected/Pending (Low Confidence) results. *This highlights the Human-in-the-Loop feature.*
4.  **The Architecture Diagram**: A clean image of the architecture diagram from `ARCHITECTURE.md`. *This highlights the technical complexity.*
